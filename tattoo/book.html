					<h3>(in)FAQ</h3>
					<p>(in)frequently asked questions.</p>
					<span>_</span>
					<p>q/ preferred styles to tattoo?</p>

					<span>_</span>
					<p>q/ do you do custom tattoos?</p>
					<p>a/ i love custom tattoos! i mainly do custom tbh. i love translating someone else 's stories into visuals. thanks for trusting me with them.</p>
					<span>_</span>
					<p>q/ do you take walk-ins?</p>
					<p>a/ no unfortunately. i currently work at a private studio, and have limited work hours.</p>
					<span>_</span>
					<p>q/ what is a deposit for?</p>
					<p>a/ a deposit is required for your appointment - commitment that you will show up. it goes towards the design and the artist's time. one-time cancellation or rescheduling must be notified 72 hours ahead of the appointment, or the deposit is non-refundable. </p>
					<span>_</span>
					<p>q/ what are the covid protocols?</p>
					<p>a/ now that we have access to vaccines, i kindly ask you to be fully vaccinated in order to protect you and our health. when entering our studio, please wear a mask. we always have extra if you need one. to limit contact, sadly no guests allowed in the space currently. you can still bring water and snacks with you, but you need to step away if you need to take off the mask. we have a hallway, and there's a beautiful backyard behind the building. </p>
					<span>_</span>
					<p>q/ what if i have skin/health conditions?</p>
					<p>a/ always consult your doctor first just to be safe. different skin type can react to ink/traumas differently. i use the 'dynamic' black ink and it's vegan. you can refer to its ingredient list <a href="https://dynamiccolor.com/pages/sds-sheets" target="_blank">here_</a>. but still, should you have any serious concern, consult your doctor first.</p>
					<span>_</span>
					<p>q/ what do i need to do prior to my session?</p>
					<p>a/ please eat :) i can't stress this enough. always make your body feel comfortable. if you are sick on the day of your session please let me know ahead of time, i'm more than willing to help you reschedule. bring water, bring snacks. let me know if you have any accessibility needs so i can try my best to accommodate you.</p>
					<span>_</span>
					<p>q/ how to heal my new tattoo?</p>
					<p>a/ let the cover stay on for a few hours (or a few days if using saniderm) before taking it off. clean your tattooed area gently with water and soap - unscented is always the best. it normally takes 2-3 weeks for a tattoo to heal. you can shower still, just don't soak it. keep it clean and dry. let it breathe. apply moisturizer accordingly once it starts scabbing. it gets itchy but please don't pick. if you have any concern always feel free to email me.</p>
