					<p>
						this has been a very personal project.<br>
						<br>
						_<br>
						content warning: illness, mental health<br>
						in the spring of 2019, i went through a life altering event. <br>
						let's just say, having been fortunately mostly ablebodied for many years and happily working in the visual arts, i wouldn't wish to lose an eye.<br>
						<br>
						_<br>
						a retinal detachment happened. <br>
						very unintended, out of nowhere. and the journey took many unexpected turns, many bed-bount months. with the lack of peer support and the distance between me and my hometown family at that time, it once became the most isolating and traumatic experience. i was led to ruminate on priorities, accessibility needs, community support, and healing of the mind. the desire to become trees, holding other trees, roots tangled.<br>
						thanks to the amazing doctors and the equally good universal health care, i eventually regained health and vision. not 20/20, but stable enough. being able to finally see, and sit up, and draw again, was one of the greatest feelings. later in the year, i took the time to slowly get used to my brand new warped vision, the permanantly damaged periphery, the light orbs and glitches, and the bizzarely slightly enlarged left pupil, while processing the unspoken sentiments piled up from the hardest months. i can't say what would happen in the future - and let's hope nothing scary would happen again. all stable for now.<br>
						if you are going through similar hardship, and are in need of peer support, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.<br>
						_<br>
						here are these sentiments, written on paper, scanned and presented to you.<br>
