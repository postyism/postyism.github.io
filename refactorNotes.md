CSS
- nav bar floating (reverse float right)
 - will try css-grid 
- project page .grid-each p. background not showing
 - how can we solve this? 
 - checkout semantic ui docs
- .html after sub pages. if it’s postyism.com/xxx/ with that dash it doesn’t work (github io issue?)
    - look into this more! 
+ mobile misc gallery grid pop out not showing full pic  .materialboxed.active{object-fit:contain;} but doesn't cross out the previous fit
    -  solved!
